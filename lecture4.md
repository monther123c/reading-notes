// What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

// The React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

// Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

// An input is said to be “controlled” when React is responsible for maintaining and setting its state. The state is kept in sync with the input’s value, meaning that changing the input will update the state, and updating the state will change the input.

// How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

// I'm interesting in this question and waiting the lecture to know the answer.

// The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

// Why would we use a ternary operator?

// Shorten your if statements into one line of code with the conditional operator.

// Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

// if(x===y){ console.log(true); } else { console.log(false); }

// (x===y) ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
