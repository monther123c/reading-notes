NODE.Js
What is node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

What is npm?

npm is the world's largest Software Registry. The registry contains over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers use npm to share software. Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

What version of node are you running on your machine?

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install jshint

What is node used for?

Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Greater efficiency
Engaged collaboration
Learning from fellow students
Social skills
Job interview readiness
Work environment readiness
In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

All of them are important

How does pair programming work?

pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator

The driver

is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
The Navigator

Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 
The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
