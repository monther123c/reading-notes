What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands. CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting. In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
