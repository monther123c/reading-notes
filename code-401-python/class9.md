# Linkedlist
---
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

## Advantages of Linked Lists

- Because of the chain-like system of linked lists, you can add and remove elements quickly. This also doesn't require reorganizing the data structure unlike arrays or lists. Linear data structures are often easier to implement using linked lists.
- inked lists also don't require a fixed size or initial size due to their chainlike structure.

## Disadvantages of a Linked Lists
- Search operations on a linked list are very slow. Unlike an array, you don't have the option of random access.

- More memory is required when compared to an array. This is because you need a pointer (which takes up its own memory) to point you to the next element.

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.


. Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element

. Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

. LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

. Linked List contains a link element called first "Head".

. Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next.

.Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.


. Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list "Tale".
