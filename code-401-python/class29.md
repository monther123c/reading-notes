### Tailwind CSS


- A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

- Faster UI building process
- It is a utility-first CSS framework which means we can use utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS as in the traditional approach.

### Advantages of Tailwind CSS:

- No more silly names for CSS classes and Idâ€™s.
- Minimum lines of Code in CSS file.
- We can customize the designs to make the components.
- Makes the website responsive.
- Makes the changes in the desired manner.
- CSS is global in nature and if make changes in the file the property is changed in all the HTML files linked to it. But with the help of Tailwind CSS we can use utility classes and make local changes.
