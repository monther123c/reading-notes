# Authentication & Production Server
---
## JSON Web Tokens
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

- Authorization
- Information Exchange

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

## DRF JWT Authentication:

JWT stand for JSON Web Token and it is an authentication strategy used by client/server applications where the client is a Web application using JavaScript and some frontend framework like Angular, React or VueJS.

The JWT is just an authorization token that should be included in all requests

The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.

The access token is usually short-lived (expires in 5 min or so, can be customized though).

The refresh token lives a bit longer (expires in 24 hours, also customizable). It is comparable to an authentication session. After it expires, you need a full login with username + password again.

It’s a security feature, and also it’s because the JWT holds a little bit more information.

At first glance the refresh token may look pointless, but in fact it is necessary to make sure the user still have the correct permissions. If your access token have a long expire time, it may take longer to update the information associated with the token. That’s because the authentication check is done by cryptographic means, instead of querying the database and verifying the data. So some information is sort of cached.

There is also a security aspect, in a sense that the refresh token only travel in the POST data. And the access token is sent via HTTP header, which may be logged along the way. So this also give a short window, should your access token be compromised.

## Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server

DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance tests.

So the server started with runserver is not guaranteed to be performant (it’s very slow), and it hasn’t been built with security concerns in mind. Not a good fit for production use.

A production setup usually consists of multiple components, each designed and built to be really good at one specific thing. They are fast, reliable and very focused.
