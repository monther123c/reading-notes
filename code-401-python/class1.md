## linked list

Linear data structure is like a hopscotch game: in arrange to reach the conclusion of the list we have to be go through all the things within the list. Linked lists  are linear data structures. The greatest distinction between arrays and linked lists is the way they utilize memory in our devices. The linked list can be straightforward, double and circular lists, and the sort of lists shows the direction of navigation. A linked list comprises of a arrangement of nodes, which are the components of the list. Linked lists must have a header, since this can be viably the as it were section point to the list and all of its components, and the conclusion of the list isn't a node point to null, or invalid.

## python names and values
1. Names are reassigned indepently ( Copy by value )
2. Python is high level language, and it got auto memory manager ( Garbge collector )
3. If you have a function that takes a list as argument and mutate it, it is recommended to return a new list
4. Function arguments are assignments, you can pass a value like string or a refrence like object to it.
5. Chaning a variable of value type it means rebinding, but changing a variable of refrence type means mutating
6. Assignment never copies data in python, it intializes a new value, or it copy the refrence .
