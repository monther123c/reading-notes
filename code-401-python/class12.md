# Stack and Queue
---
Data structure organizes the storage in computers so that we can easily access and change data. Stacks and Queues are the earliest data structure defined in computer science. A simple Python list can act as a queue and stack as well. A queue follows FIFO rule (First In First Out) and used in programming for sorting. It is common for stacks and queues to be implemented with an array or linked list.
 
 ## Stack :
 A Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle. To implement a stack, we need two simple operations: 
 
 1- push - It adds an element to the top of the stack.

 2- pop - It removes an element from the top of the stack

 ## Queue :

 A Queue follows the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is opened from both the ends hence we can easily add elements to the back and can remove elements from the front.

 enqueue : It adds an element to the end of the queue.

 dequeue : It removes the element from the beginning of the queue
