# Serverless Functions
---
What is Serverless? Serverless is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code without managing servers, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.

Serverless DOES NOT mean 'NO servers' Serverless simply means that the customer does not need to worry about managing or configuring the servers themselves. The provider takes care of all of that for them.

Serverless is more than just FaaS

FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) is a type of cloud-computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.

Serverless is focused on any service category, be it compute, storage, database, messaging, api gateways, etc. where configuration, management, and billing of servers are invisible to the end user.

 FaaS, on the other hand, while perhaps the most central technology in serverless architectures, is focused on the event-driven computing paradigm wherein application code, or containers, only run in response to events or requests.

  ## Use cases for serverless
Serverless and microservices The microservices model is focused on creating small services that do a single job and communicate with one another using APIs.
API backends
Data processing
Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations
Stream processing workloads
