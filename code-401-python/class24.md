# DRF Permissions
---
Django REST framework Permissions, permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access.

Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed. Permission checks will typically use the authentication information in the request.user and request.auth properties to determine if the incoming request should be permitted.


Permissions are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API.
---
## How permissions are determined
Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

### Object level permissions
REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

### Setting the permission policy
The default permission policy may be set globally, using the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES setting.

You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.

Or, if you're using the @api_view decorator with function based views.
