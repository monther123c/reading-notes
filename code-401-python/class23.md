# Django REST Framework & Docker
---
Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. We handle the tedious setup, so you can focus on the code. -Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup.

### Linux Containers
- Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.
- Virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm.

### Containers vs Virtual Environments
- Virtualization aims to run multiple OS instances on a single server, whereas containerization runs a single OS instance, with multiple user spaces to isolate processes from one another. This means containerization makes sense for one AWS cloud user that plans to run multiple processes simultaneously.

### Images and Containers
- Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker. An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. A container is a running instance of the image.
- Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
- Images are made up of one or more layers
- Containers are a running instance of an image
- docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
- Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didn’t cover here).

## Django for APIs - Library Website
- We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework. It always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.
### Traditional Django
- A traditional Django website consists of a single project with multiple apps representing discrete functionality

### Django REST Framework
- Web API will expose a single endpoint that lists out all books in JSON. To do this, it will need a new URL route, a new view, and a new serializer file.
- Django REST Framework views are similar except the end result is serialized data in JSON format, not the content for a web page! Django REST Framework views rely on a model, a URL, and a new file called a serializer

### Serializers
- A serializer translates complex data like querysets and model instances into a format that is easy to consume over the internet, typically JSON.
- It is also possible to “deserialize” data, literally the same process in reverse, whereby JSON data is first validated and then transformed into a dictionary.
### Browsable API
- Django REST Framework ships with a built-in browsable API that displays both the content and HTTP verbs associated with a given endpoint.
