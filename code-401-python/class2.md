Unit Tests vs Test-Driven Development

Unit Tests are a snipit of code to test the input in your code and how would it behave. Hoever, Test-Driven Development is a way of thinking, were you write the tests first, before the actual code.

The Process of Writing Tests in Test-Driven Development

We need to think about two main things, AAA and The Cycle.

AAA; is the structure of thinking and it means Arrange, Act and Assert. Where you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code, this is called Arrange. Then you need to start the execution process and this is called Act and finally you need to check the result and compare it to the expexted result.

The Cycle; is the act of doing the actual TDD in baby steps, where you write the unit test and make it fail as there is noe feature to it yet, following, you need to write the feature and make it pass to one condition at a time, finally you need to refactor your code to make it presentable and beautiful.

What are Modules?

Modules refers to the act of Modular programming which is breaking a large, un wiedly programming task into a seperate, smaller, more manageable subtasks.
