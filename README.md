
Basic information about React and Components
first lets discuss the meaning of a component : A component modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface

**Components have many Characteristics which are : **

Reusability : Usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications
Replaceable : Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
Not context Specific : designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
Extensible : Can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
Encapsulated : We can Used it without exposing any internal parts
Independent : Made in way to have minimal dependencies on other components.
Advantages of using Componentâˆ’Based Design :

Ease of deployment : easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
Reduced cost : The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
Ease of development : allows development without impacting other parts of the system
Reusable : The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
Modification of technical complexity : A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
Reliability : system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
System maintenance and evolution : Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
Independent : Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.
Moving to Props by starting of with the meaning of it !
Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

But how can Props be used it react ?

Pass in props as an argument
Declare props variable(s)
Use variable(s) in JSX template
Pass data to props in the App component
Finally lets discuss the flow of props? Props has a flow that is called the uni-directional flow which is a one way flow from parent to child also , props is a read only and becasue of that what comes from the parent cannot be changed by the child .

Things I want to know more about
What does it look like implementing them in a real project and I would like to try it ourselves soon .
