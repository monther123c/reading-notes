React State vs Props
What types of things can you pass in the props?

Any JavaScript data type from integers over objects to arrays. Via props you can even pass React components

What is the big difference between props and state?

In props you pass into component and handled and update outside of the component while as state is handled inside of that component and we can update it inside the component

When do we re-render our application?

When you change the state inside of your application it’s going to re-render this section of your application but props can’t change them

What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

If you need to re-render and update your application or if you want to change something in your application you should store that in state

One of the example is if you have a count in your application, you need to re-render and update it, so you should store it in state -->
